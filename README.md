### [Clinical NLP](https://github.com/HzaCode/ClinNLP)

A Python framework demonstrating a pipeline for processing clinical text to predict Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), **addressing the challenge of extracting critical safety information from unstructured records**. This repository currently serves as a foundational demonstration, which is intended as a starting point for future development into comprehensive resources for the clinical NLP community.
